# MetaFX

**MetaFX** (METAgenomic Feature eXtraction) is an open-source library for feature extraction from whole-genome metagenome sequencing data and classification of groups of samples.

The idea behind **MetaFX** is to introduce feature extraction algorithm specific for metagenomics short reads data. It is capable of processing hundreds of samples 1-10 Gb each. The distinct property of suggest approach is the construction of meaningful features, which can not only be used to train classification model, but also can be further annotated and biologically interpreted.

It contains a lot of modelus divided into three groups:

1. Unsupervised feature extraction pipelines.
2. Supervised feature extraction pipelines.
3. Methods for classification and interpretation.


TBD
